%TOC%

The module uses the standard =getpw*= functions to check passwords against
the =/etc/passwd= file. Thus any user who has an entry in =/etc/passwd=
on your server is able to log in to the wiki. It is intended for use
with the =TemplateLogin= manager.

<blockquote>
This module will _only_ work with passwords that are stored in
=/etc/passwd=. Most systems use shadow passwords, and the
=getpwnam= call that this module uses to access the password
_only_ checks for the password in the =/etc/passwd= file.
</blockquote>

You can get a good idea whether the module will work for you by running
a small fragment of perl *as the Apache user*
<verbatim>
perl -e 'for $i (1..10) { print join(" ",getpwnam),"\n" }'
</verbatim>
This will print the first 10 entries in =/etc/passwd=. If the second field
of each user entry is always 'x', then you probably can't access the passwords
this way.

Note that =/etc/passwd= is read-only, and you will not be able to add users,
change or reset passwords from Foswiki.
